🧠 **Library Catalog Project (Command Line)**

Hi! 👋 This is one of the beginner Python projects I created to practice working with files, user input, and simple menus. It’s a command-line tool that lets you create and manage a mini digital library catalog.

💡 **Why I Made This**

I wanted to go beyond basic print/input exercises and try something that uses **file handling**, **lists**, and **functions** in a real-world way. A library catalog felt like a cool and practical idea for that!

🚀 **What It Does**  

Here’s how this project works:

- You can **add a new book** (title, author, and year).
- You can **view all books** that have been saved.
- You can **search for a book by its title**.
- The catalog data is saved to a `.txt` file, so it persists even after you exit.

Example:

Welcome to the Library Catalog!

Add a new book

View all books

Search for a book

Exit

🛠️ **Tools I Used**

- Python 3.x  
- File I/O using `open()`  
- Lists, loops, conditionals, and string functions  
- Basic CLI (Command Line Interface)

🙋‍♀️ **About Me**

I'm Rasi Shil, a Linguistics student diving into Python and programming one small project at a time. This project helped me understand how programs can read and write data and how even a simple idea like a book catalog can turn into code! 📚
